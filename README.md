Implementation of `scope_guard` and `unique_resource` as proposed in [**P0052**][2] (former [N3949][1]).


## Compatibility

This implementation conforms to [P0052][2], except:

###### Namespace
Another namespace is used instead of `std`.

###### Filenames
The filenames contain a `.h` extension.

These deviations are necessary through standard requirements.

###### std::uncaught_exceptions()
The function `std::uncaught_exceptions()` is not available in C++14 and is therefore replaced with `std::uncaught_exception()`. This has some limitations, but is the only solution until C++17 is used.
