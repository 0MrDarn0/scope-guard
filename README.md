Implementation of *Scope Guards* (`scope_exit`, `scope_success`, `scope_fail`) and `unique_resource` as proposed in [**P0052R5**][2] (former [N3949][1]).


## Compatibility

This implementation conforms to [P0052][2], except:

###### Namespace
The namespace `sr` is used instead of `std`.

###### Filenames
The filenames contain a `.h` extension. To enable the compatible header as specified in the document the CMake option `ENABLE_COMPAT_HEADER` can be used. This will generate and install an additional header named `scope` (without file extension).

###### std::uncaught_exceptions()
The function `std::uncaught_exceptions()` is not available in C++14 and is therefore replaced with `std::uncaught_exception()`. This has some limitations, but is the only solution until C++17 is used.


## Implementation decisions

###### Factory functions
The Factory functions for both types are kept for the C++14 implementations as *deduction guides* aren't available.
