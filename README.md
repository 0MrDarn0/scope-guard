Implementation of *Scope Guards* (`scope_exit`, `scope_success`, `scope_fail`) and `unique_resource` as proposed in [**P0052R10**][2] (former [N3949][1]).


## Compatibility

This implementation conforms to [P0052][2], except:

###### Namespace
The namespace `sr` is used instead of `std`.

###### Filenames
The filenames contain a `.h` extension. To enable the compatible header as specified in the document the CMake option `ENABLE_COMPAT_HEADER` can be used. This will generate and install an additional header named `scope` (without file extension).
